# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
###
Step 1:
Import the numpy module to use the built-in function for calculation

Step 2:
Prepare the lists from each equations and assign in np.aaray()

Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.solve(),we can find the solutions.

Step 4:
End the program
## Program:
```

```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
